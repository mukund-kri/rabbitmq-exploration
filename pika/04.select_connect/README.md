# Pika in Async mode

Setting up a connection to RabbitMQ in async mode is a bit more complex than in sync 
mode. The following example shows how to use the `SelectConnection` class to connect
to RabbitMQ in async mode.


I have failed to understand how to use the `SelectConnection` class. 

- Copying the code from the official documentation works. But that is long and 
  complex, where the functonality is wrapped in a class.
- I have failed to write code from first principles.


## Now what?

I am going to abandon this for now. I might come back to it later.
